# Demonstration
The objective is to take a csv containing data, and print it to the console in neatly formatted columns, with a bar graph depicting the data contained in the final column.

Output:
![2022-03-06-123228_3440x1440_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26313286/156934956-95844102-8a2f-4a16-a920-1cd5361cb2a8.png)


Current Limitations:
<ul>
    <li>Columns won't line up if the values in a given column vary more than 8 characters in length.</li>
    <li>Script will fail if the final column contains anything other than numerical data.</li>
    <li>Cannot graph negative values.</li>
</ul>
